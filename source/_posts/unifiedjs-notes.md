- Content as structured data

```
unified is two things:

unified is a collective of 500+ free and open source packages that work with content as structured data (ASTs)
unified is the core package to inspect and transform content with plugins
Different kinds of content can be connected together. Particularly, markdown, natural language, HTML, XML, and JavaScript are frequently used.

for how the collective is governed, see unifiedjs/collective
