## 基础
### React Router
- 
```
If you're using React Router, you should never import anything directly from the react-router package, but you should have everything you need in either react-router-dom or react-router-native. Both of those packages re-export everything from react-router.
```
- web用react-router-dom，react native 用react-router-native
- connected-react-router - https://www.npmjs.com/package/connected-react-router - A Redux binding for React Router v4 and v5
- https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5 - withRouter 的使用变更，可以用hooks代替
