 In general, statements are not evaluated but executed; they do not produce a value but instead make some change.

 ```
 >>> x = 3
does not return a value nor evaluate a function on some arguments, since the purpose of assignment is instead to bind a name to a value.
 ```

 JS当中：
 ```
> a = 1
1
 ```
