## Project Structure

This repository employs a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) setup which hosts a number of associated packages under the `packages` directory:

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 10+**, and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io).

We also recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) to help switching between repos using different package managers. `ni` also provides the handy `nr` command which running npm scripts easier.

```

- Install yarn: We use yarn to handle our JavaScript dependencies. (plain npm doesn't work due to our monorepo setup) See the yarn documentation for instructions on installing it.
