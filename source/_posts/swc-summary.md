nestjs 10 使用了SWC
- SWC（快速网络编译器）是一个基于 Rust 的可扩展平台，可用于编译和捆绑。将 SWC 与 Nest CLI 结合使用，是显著加快开发过程的简单好方法。
SWC 的速度约为默认 TypeScript 编译器的 20 倍

SWC is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno, as well as companies like Vercel, ByteDance, Tencent, Shopify, and more.

SWC can be used for both compilation and bundling. For compilation, it takes JavaScript / TypeScript files using modern JavaScript features and outputs valid code that is supported by all major browsers.

SWC is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.
